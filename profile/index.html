    <h2>My story</h2>
    <p>Im Ponatshego Ramagaga I reside in Riverside view yellowwood i stay with my uncle , little sister and my cousin.
    I complited my matric on the year 2019 at Sunrise secondary school at Diepsloot extension 5. I am an indoor person 
    ,I love my own space. I also love learning new things like what my life science onc told me and i qoute "sometimes 
    you have to know a little bit of everything" .i work hard no matter how obsticles come my way i always try my best to overcome 
    them. Nothing comes easy so everything you do requires hardwork and determination that what keeps me going. And also the qoute that says the
    only time you fail it is when you fall and stay down. I wanted to see myself not only a successful woman but i want 
    to creat things change peoples lives.
